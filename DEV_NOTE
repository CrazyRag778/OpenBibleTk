Subject: Migration to CustomTkinter

Dear Developer, 
    Yes! I'm speaking to you! Fella!
    I've learned a new tkinter module.
    And I'm going to transfer to it.
    So, I want you to keep up with this branch. 
    Consider this branch as the main branch because we need to migrate the whole project.
    No functions have been changed.
    No major change until next week.
    Hope you're doing well! 
    Thank you!
